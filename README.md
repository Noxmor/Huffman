# Huffman
Implementation of the Huffman Algorithm in C with options for encoding and decoding.

***

## Features

* Constructing the ideal huffman tree
* Parsing text
* Encoding
* Decoding

***

## Getting Started
1. Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Noxmor/Huffman`.

2. Compile the `main.c` found in `huffman/main.c` with your C Compiler of choice.

3. Done!

***

## How to use
This program can construct the ideal huffman tree for a given input string. Just call the program with the string as an argument in order to see the tree.
**Example**: `huffman --encode "This is an example input."`
For more information, see the `Flags` section.

***

## Flags
* --encode (-e) for displaying the encoded string.
* --decode (-d) for displaying the decoded string.

***

## Known bugs
Currently none.
